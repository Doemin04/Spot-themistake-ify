Purpose of project:
This is our submission for the 2025 UGAHacks Hackathon HPCC Challenge.

Tools utilized:
OpenAI, Github

Challenges we ran into:
Debugging in ECL is challenging due to its limited online presence. Solutions and community discussions were rare. We alo had to deal with an unfamiliar programming language and frequent syntax errors. We had to rely on provided ECL documentation, trial and error, and logical thinking to overcame the obstacle. 
Currently, one known issue still remains. That is in file BWR3, our 'Coldplay' playlist only returned 6 rows instead of 9. We tried tackling it by trimming white spaces and checking for case sensitivity but couldn't find any resources addressing this issue.

We really appreciate this fun opportunity and the insight we gained into HPCC Systems through practical challenges.
